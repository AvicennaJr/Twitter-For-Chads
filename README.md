# Twitter For Chads
Twitter app made for Real Men.

A simple app made with FastAPI in the Backend and Godot in the Frontend.

How to use this:
  - Install <a href="godot.org">Godot</a>
  - Install the python packages in requirements.txt
  - Make sure you have a <a href="developers.twitter.com">Developer Twitter Account</a>
  - Place your API keys and access tokens at backend/keys.py
  - Run the FastAPI client first
  - Tweet like a chad with godot

This is the most basic version, I intend to improve it with time.

Anyone interested in contributing to the project is welcomed.
